Good afternoon everyone, I'm Anh from IP Design 2. Today is my turn to conduct the afternoon speech. I hope you had a nice holiday with your
friends, family and will have a better year than last one. Today I would like to say a little bit about a book, maybe some or many of you already
know this book, its name is "Con Duong di Den Su Thanh Cong bang su tu te", the author is Inamori Kazuo, he is the founder of Kyocera and he 
was the chairman of Japan airlines. This book told about the Inamori's vision of life, attitude towards the life, how to treat to the people .
I've learned many things from this book, such as the inamori scarifies. Even in the toughest situation and related to benefit of himself, 
he still think about his staff. As my feeling, his thinking come from the kindness, pure soul, no unfairness, no tu loi. There are more than 
what I said, but I can't express all of them and because every people has their own perspective. If you interest, you can read this book and 
have your own feeling. One statement I like is "Thành công đến từ sự lợi dụng thời thế nhất thời mà không quan tấm đến lợi ích của mọi người 
sẽ không kéo dài được lâu". Once again, wish you have a good new year. That's all for my afternoon speech, thank you for your attention.
